Our research vision embraces the use of science and technology as a means to make breakthroughs that will benefit humans and our planet by bringing solutions to serious societal problems, particularly in healthcare. The problem of lack of timely access to quality healthcare is increasingly affecting many in need, often due to shortcomings in hospital-centered systems increasingly burdened by the abundant ailments of an expanding population of the elderly. The recent pandemic has additionally exposed vulnerabilities in medical supply availability. All of this underscores the utility of improving access to advanced biomedical technologies - such as wearable devices - that could reduce the reliance on equipment and instruments located within hospital buildings. That is the strength and promise of wearable devices, such as epidermal/ implantable biosensors: Based on wearable technologies that are low-cost, sustainably produced, and readily accessible, key physical health conditions can be observed at user-centric settings in real-time, and proactive treatment can be administered before severe illnesses advance to a life-threatening stage. In some cases, these devices themselves can provide therapeutic deliverables, such as drugs or electrical stimulation, a point-of-care method promising to revolutionize parts of the healthcare system by decreasing the load on hospitals. Providing reliable information in this timely and actionable manner has the potential to save both lives and financial resources. 

Our research focuses on the development of sustainable and/or eco/bioresorbable electronic/microfluidic devices, biosensors, and energy storage solutions designed for applications in health monitoring and disease treatment. Our primary interest lies in investigating materials and structures that can be effectively utilized and processed cost-effectively, environmentally friendly, sustainable, and scalable. This pursuit aims to create affordable, scalable, and sustainable technologies that address challenges within the healthcare field.
