# Research Vision and Goals
Our research aims to leverage science and technology to address serious societal problems, especially in healthcare. The growing elderly population and the recent pandemic have highlighted the challenges of timely access to quality healthcare and the vulnerabilities in medical supply chains. Our focus is on advanced biomedical technologies, such as low-cost, sustainable, and accessible wearable devices like epidermal and implantable biosensors. These devices enable real-time health monitoring and proactive treatment in user-centric settings, potentially reducing hospital dependence. In some cases, they can provide therapeutic interventions, such as drug delivery or electrical stimulation, offering a point-of-care solution that could revolutionize healthcare by alleviating hospital burdens and saving lives and resources.

Our research focuses on the development of sustainable and/or eco/bioresorbable electronic/microfluidic devices, biosensors, and energy storage solutions designed for applications in health monitoring and disease treatment. Our primary interest lies in investigating materials and structures that can be effectively utilized and processed cost-effectively, environmentally friendly, sustainable, and scalable. This pursuit aims to create affordable, scalable, and sustainable technologies that address challenges within the healthcare field.
